                writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless

                law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to

                rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in
                Hawaii, Hawaii. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties

          These Legal Terms and any policies or operating rules posted by us on
          the Services or in respect to the Services constitute the entire
          agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure to
          exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Legal Terms shall
          not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These Legal Terms
          operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. We may assign any or
          all of our rights and obligations to others at any time. We shall not
          be responsible or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to
          act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable control. If any
          provision or part of a provision of these Legal Terms is determined to
          be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the
          provision is deemed severable from these Legal Terms and does not
          affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
          There is no joint venture, partnership, employment or agency
          relationship created between you and us as a result of these Legal
          Terms or use of the Services. You agree that these Legal Terms will
          not be construed against us by virtue of having drafted them. You
          hereby waive any and all defenses you may have based on the electronic
          form of these Legal Terms and the lack of signing by the parties
          hereto to execute these Legal Terms.
